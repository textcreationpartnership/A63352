            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                        <p>THAT notwithſtanding the late Parliament Summoned to meet at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> was Diſſolved before any thing was done; yet your Petitioners being ſatisfied, That thoſe Worthy perſons, Choſen to repreſent this Honourable City, did not only give their Attendance there, but faithfully diſcharged their duties according to the Repreſentation and deſire made to them by the Common-Hall at their Choice, do humbly conceive, That they deſerve the Thanks and Acknowledgments of the City.</p>
                        <p>That on the 28th of <hi>April,</hi> on occaſion of another Petition, ſome of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners (and other Citizens) did humbly Petition the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen for the Calling of a Common-Council, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which Petition not being Tranſcribed till the Court was ſitting, there were but few perſons who did then Sign the ſame, for want of time (and even now are ſtraitned in that reſpect); but your Petitioners below, and many thouſands would have ſubſcrib'd it, had the ſame been ſent abroad, and offered as the other was.</p>
                        <p>That tho' on the Anſwer given by the Court of Aldermen, your Petitioners went away ſutisfied, and hoped the others had done the like; yet afterwards they found in Print a Declaration, put in the Name of the Subſcribers to the ſaid other Petition (without the conſent or knowledge of moſt of them (as your Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners believe) tending to a Defamation of all that differed from their way of proceeding, thereby to beget feuds and diviſions in the City, which might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger the Peace, and bring a ſcandal on the good Government thereof.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray, that this Honourable Court would be pleaſed in ſome publick way to own the faithful Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and Service of their late Repreſentatives in Parliament; And alſo to take into their ſerious Conſideration the matter of the ſaid Petition, a Copy whereof is hereunto annexed (which Petition was formerly printed) and thereupon to reſolve on what they ſhall find moſt for the Honour of his Majeſty, the Safety of his Royal Perſon, the Security of the Proteſtant Religion to Poſterity, and the Peace and Proſperity of this City.</hi>

            <p>The ſaid Petition being after ſome debate relating to the Petitioners that preſented it, the Court took the ſame into conſideration; and on the debate touching the firſt part, the Court being well ſatisfied, that the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers who ſerved for this City in the three laſt Parliaments, had faithfully diſcharged their duties,</p>
            <p>Ordered,
<q>That the thanks of this Court in the name of themſelves and all the Citizens of this City, be given to the ſaid Members (<hi>viz.</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Clayton,</hi> Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Player,</hi> Alderman <hi>Thomas Pilkington,</hi> and <hi>William Love,</hi> Eſq;) for their faithful and unwearied ſervice in the ſaid Parliaments, and particularly in the Parliament at <hi>Oxford.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>After which, it being late, about Three of the Clock, a debate aroſe, whether the Court would then at that time proceed to the conſideration of the other part of the Petition, now or not; and on the queſtion it was reſolved in the Affirmative, there being 84 Commons and 7 Aldermen, which make 91. together, for a preſent proceeding therein, and but 66. Commons and 11. Aldermen, which is together but 77. for deferring the ſame.</p>
            <p>The Court then proceeding on the conſideration of the ſaid matters, it was on the debate, with a general conſent, reſolved, and the Court did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate and appoint Sir <hi>Robert Clayton,</hi> Knight, and Alderman, Mr. Recorder, and <hi>Thomas Pilkington,</hi> Alderman, Sir <hi>Thomas Player</hi> Knight, Mr. <hi>Dubois,</hi> Mr. <hi>William Aſhurſt,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Weſterne,</hi> Eſq; Commoners, to withdraw, and immediately to prepare a Petition to His Majeſty upon the debates then had, and the ſubject-matter of the ſaid Petition.</p>
            <p>The ſaid Gentlemen accordingly withdrew, and after ſome time returned again to the Court, and there preſented the draught of a Petition to His Majeſty, which Petition is already Printed.</p>
            <p>On the reading of the ſaid Petition, it was ſo well approved, that on the queſtion there appeared not above 4. or 6. hands againſt the preſenting the ſame to his Majeſty, which the Court ordered ſhould be done to morrow, or as ſoon as conveniently might be; and the Court nominated and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sir <hi>Robert Clayton,</hi> Mr. Recorder, Sir <hi>Henry Tulſe,</hi> and Mr. Sheriff <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh,</hi> Mr. <hi>Swynock, Tho. Weſterne,</hi> Eſq; Mr. <hi>Michael Godfrey,</hi> and Mr. Deputy <hi>Flawell,</hi> to preſent the ſame to His Majeſty accordingly.</p>
            <p>Then the Court reſolved and ordered,
<q>That the thanks of the Court be given to thoſe perſons who ſigned and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the Petition, now preſented to, and read in this Court, for their Care and good intentions therein expreſt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The ſaid perſons were then called in, and Mr. Recorder in a very elegant and excellent Speech gave them thanks accordingly.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Saturday</hi> the 14th of <hi>May,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Clayton,</hi> and others of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons appointed, did repair to <hi>Windſor,</hi> to have preſented the ſaid Petition; but were acquainted, that on <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 19th of <hi>May,</hi> His Majeſty would be at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> where they might attend him; which accordingly they did, and preſented the ſaid Petition to His Majeſty, in purſuance of the Order of Common-Council.</p>
